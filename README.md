# unity-card-game

An untitled Card Game built in Unity

---

### Prototype/Demo

The initial plan for this project is to build the base mechanics of this game in Unity from a course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-to-code-trading-card-game-battle-system-with-unity-3d/). This will include basic card combat mechanics, different card types (such as creatures and spells), heroes and hero powers and two different combat modes, PvC and offline PvP.

Once all these mechanics have been created (and the Udemy Course complete), a few extra bits will be added in. These will mainly be UI elements, such as a title screen, menu screen and options/settings.

### Future Plans

Once the prototype/demo is complete and polished off, it will be released on my [itch.io](https://allusinteractive.itch.io/) page. Future plans for this game include deck customization, card customization, hero selection and card packs.
